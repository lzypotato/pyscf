class NAC(object):
    '''
    Class for non-adiabatic-coupling (NAC).
    Get single molecular structures from mc and create dimer to calculate overlapAO
    Final result of NAC is < \Psi_{nstate1} | \frac{\partial}{\partial R} | \Psi_{nstate2} >

    return NAC and 2-by-2 overlap matrix between mcscf wavefunction.

    mc1 & mc2:  Input CASCI/CASSCF class for two kinds of molecular structures.
